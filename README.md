# Anti-Spoofing-Liveness-Detection
A facial authentication layer designed to defeat "presentation attacks" (holding up a photo or video of the user).

    Method: 3D Face Mesh tracking.

    Checks: * Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): Detects a natural blink.

        Head Pose Estimation: Ensures the face is a 3D object by requiring a horizontal turn.

    Security Angle: Validates that the subject is a "live" human being, not a static image
